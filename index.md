# Interest in IT 

Currently, I am very interest in cybersecurity and game designing aspects of Information Technology. This interest started when I became aware that we are living in the advanced technologies, where our personal information are vulnerable to the whole world, including hackers out there. Therefore, I started to wonder how the current computer program such as Firewalls, Norton works in order to provide the protection that we need in a fast moving, advance technologies world. The more information I start to read about how these programs work, it motivates me to develop my own program that would fully provide protection to the users across the world. 

I chose to come to RMIT to complete my bachelor of Information Technology because I believed that RMIT university is the most suitable university for me. This includes academic aspects such as RMIT demands high standard work, yet the workload is very manageable. Additionally, I believe RMIT provides a lot of resources to help with my studies, counselling and other services to help me complete my study at my best. Furthermore, RMIT has been well known for its advance technologies and architectures. Therefore, after weighting all of the disadvantages and advantages, I decided that RMIT is suitable for me compare to other university. 

I expect to learn a lot of information with a lot of problem solving skills both in theory and experiments. Additionally, I expect to gain a lot of knowledge that would prepare me to enter the workforce after I complete this course. Furthermore, not only these expectations, I also believe that this course would allow me to specialise in my interest areas, that is, game designing and cybersecurity and a way to improve the current techniques in game designing and cybersecurity.
